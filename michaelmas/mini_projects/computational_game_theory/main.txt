Introduction

Consider the following scenario: someone is holding a yard sale and have m items up for sale. There are n
potential buyers, each interested in buying subsets of these items, and each of whom have some valuation
of each subset of the items. Which scheme should the seller come up with in order to efficiently allocate
the items he his selling to the buyers.
In this mini project we will focus on two types of mechanism designs: simultaneous first-price auctions
and simultaneous second-price auctions. Intuitively these are auctions in which every bidder places a bid
for each item simultaneously and the one with the highest bid for a specific item receives that item. The
only difference is in what he must pay. For first-price auctions the highest bidder pays his highest bid
while for second-price auctions the highest bidder only pays the bid of the second highest bidder. To
formalize this a bit we introduce the notion of “mechansims”.

1.1

Auctions as mechanisms

Definition 1.1 (Mechanism [ST13]). A mechanism M is a triple M = (A, X, P ), where A = ×i Ai is
a set of actions Ai for each player i, X : A → X is an allocation function that maps each action profile
a ∈ A to an outcome x ∈ X ⊂ ×i Xi (where Xi is the set of allocations for Player i), and P : A → Rn≥0 is
a payment function that maps each action profile to a payment Pi for each player i. The utility of player
i for some valuation vi : Xi → R≥0 , and allocation xi ∈ Xi is defined to be
uvi i (xi ) = vi (xi ) − Pi (xi )

(1.1)

Here the allocation function vi is part of some set of valuations Vi which is a representation of how
much a player i values a subset of outcomes. It would be strange to assume that a buyer knows exactly
how the other buyers value a set of items. However, he could make an educated guess as to the distribution
of potential valuations and assume another buyer gets his valuation from this distribution. We therefore
say that a mechanism is in the Bayesian setting if for each player i ∈ [n] the valuation vi is drawn from
Vi according to some known distribution Fi . The Fi are assumed to be independent of each other. In this
case we have a mechanism of incomplete information. Conversely, if each player’s valuation vi is fixed
and known to all the other players then we are in the full information setting.
1

Now, in the case of our yard sale we are selling off each item individually and at the same time. Thus
we are essentially looking at a “simultaneous composition” of single-item auctions. More formally, assume
that there are n players and m mechanisms {Mj = (Aj , X j , P j )}m
j=1 . We make the extra assumption that
each player has a valuation over vectors of outcomes from each mechanism, i.e., functions vi : Xi → R≥0
where Xi = ×j Xij .
Definition 1.2 (Simultaneous composition of mechanisms [ST13]). Given m mechanisms {Mj }m
j=1 as
described above with n bidders/players we define the simultaneous composition of these mechanisms
to beP
the mechanism M = (A, X, P ) where Ai = ×j Aji , X = ×j X j , X = ×j X j :P
A → X , and
P = j P j : A → R≥0 . For a ∈ A we therefore have that X(a) = (X j (aj ))j and P (a) = j P j (aj ) with
aj denoting the jth component of a.
In the context of the above definitions we can formalize the notion of an auction as well as first/secondprice auctions.
Definition 1.3 (Combinatorial auction). Let I be a set of items. A combinatorial auction is a
mechanism M = (A, X, P ) where Xi = 2I (the powerset of I), X consists of partitions of I, and Ai = Bi
is the set of bids player i can make. Moreover, each vi ∈ Vi is assumed to be normalized and monotone,
that is vi (∅) = 0 and S ⊆ T =⇒ vi (S) ≤ vi (T ).
Definition 1.4 (First-price auction). A first-price auction is a combinatorial auction M in which the
allocation function X : A → X is described by allocating items to the highest bidder. The price a player
must pay for the allocation is equal to the bid if he has the highest bid and zero otherwise.
Definition 1.5 (Second-price auction). A second-price auction is a combinatorial auction M in which
the allocation function X : A → X is described by allocating items to the highest bidder. The price a
player must pay for the allocation is equal to the bid of the second highest bidder if he has the highest bid
and zero otherwise.
A simultaneous first/second-price auction is then just a simultaneous composition of first/secondprice auctions. To more formally state our problem we also need a way to talk about how efficient or
inefficient a particular allocation of items is.

1.2

Nash equilibria and the price of anarchy

Definition 1.6 (Strategy). Let M = (A, X, P ) be a mechanism. A strategy profile s = (s1 , . . . , sn ) is a
probability distribution over A such that each si is a probability distribution over Ai and is independent of
sj for j =
6 i. A pure strategy is a strategy profile s such that each component si has probability measure 1
on a single outcome ai ∈ Ai . Conversely, a mixed strategy is not a pure strategy. The utility for Player
i of a strategy profile is defined to be ui (s) = Es∼s [ui (Xi (s))].
Definition 1.7 (Nash equilibria). Let M = (A, X, P ) be a mechanism and V = ×i Vi the corresponding
valuations. Let F = ×i Fi be a distribution over V. Let s be a strategy profile over A. Then, s is called a
• pure Nash equilibrium, if s is a pure strategy and ui (s) ≥ ui (s0i , s−i ) for all pure strategies s0i
over Ai ,
• mixed Nash equilibrium, if s is a strategy profile and ui (s) ≥ ui (s0i , s−i ) for all strategies s0i over
Ai ,
• Bayesian Nash equilibrium, if s(v) is a strategy profile dependent upon v ∼ F and
Ev−i ,s∼s(v) [ui (s)] ≥ Ev−i ,s∼s(v) [ui (s0i , s−i )]
for all strategies s0i over Ai .
It is reasonable to think that left to their own devices the buyers could end up choosing a strategy
profile which is one of the equilibrium types mentioned above. However, this choice might be far from
optimal.
Definition 1.8 (Social welfare). Let M be a mechanism. The social welfare of a strategy s given a
valuation profile v ∈ V is defined to be
SW v (s) =

n
X

Es∼s [vi (Xi (s))].

Similarly, given a distribution F over valuations V the social welfare of a strategy s is
SW F (s) =

Ev∼F ,s∼s(v) [vi (Xi (s))].

(1.3)

i=1

Note that SW v is a special case of SW F in which the probability measure of F is 1 for a specific valuation
profile v.
Definition 1.9 (Price of Anarchy (PoA)). Let M be a mechanisms and let EM denote a corresponding
set of equilibrium strategies. With SM denoting the set of all strategies, the price of anarchy (PoA) for
a distribution F over V is
maxs∈S SW F (s)
P oAM,F =

(1.4)
mins0 ∈EM SW F (s0 )
In the full information setting we restrict F to have probability measure 1 for a specific valuation profile v.
Letting M denote the set of all mechanisms of a specific class and FM the set of all relevant distributions
for M ∈ M (depending upon whether we are in the full information or Bayesian setting). The price of
anarchy of M is then

Different types of valuations

When defining our problem we are not interested in all types of valuations for a given mechanism M. We
want to restrict ourselves to a specific class of valuations V.
Definition 1.10. Let M be a mechanism and vi : X → R≥0 a valuation for player i ∈ [n]. We say that
vi is
P
• additive, if vi (S) = x∈S for all S ⊂ Xi ,
• submodular, if vi (S ∪ T ) + vi (S ∩ T ) ≤ vi (S) + vi (T ) for all S, T ⊂ Xi ,
• fractionally subadditive (or XOS), if vi is determined by a finite set of additive valuations fγ
for γ ∈ Γ such that vi (S) = maxγ∈Γ fγ (S),
• subadditive, if vi (S ∪ T ) ≤ vi (S) + vi (T ) for all S, T ⊂ Xi .
It is well known that each of the above classes are contained in the next one, i.e., additive valuations
are submodular, submodular valuations are XOS, and XOS are subadditive.

1.4

The problem statement

Having set up necessary terminology we can now properly state the problem we want to investigate.
Problem 1. Consider simultaneous first-price auctions. What are the currently known upper and lower
bounds on the price of anarchy for submodular and subadditive valuations over mixed Bayesian and
Bayesian-Nash equilibria respectively?

Bounds on the Price of Anarchy

2.1

Smooth mechanisms

To derive the upper bounds for simultaneous first-price auctions we will outline the approach taken in
[ST13] of defining smooth mechanisms and then deriving general bounds for smooth mechanisms and the
composition of smooth mechanisms. In the following we let uvi i (a) denote the expected utility of a player
i ∈ [n] with valuation vi when the randomized strategy vector a is played.
Definition 2.1 (Smooth mechanism [ST13]). A mechanism M is (λ, µ)-smooth for some λ, µ ≥ 0, if
there exists a randomized action profile a∗i (v, ai ) that is dependent on the whole valuation profile v ∈ ×i Vi

3

and the player’s action ai ∈ Ai , such that for any valuation profile v ∈ ×i Vi and for any action profile
a ∈ ×i Ai we have

i=1 vi (xi ).

As we will see, first-price auctions are smooth and so we would like to say something about the
simultaneous composition of smooth mechanisms.
Theorem 2.2 (Simultaneous composition [ST13]). Let M be a simultaneous composition of m smooth
mechanisms. Suppose that each component mechanism Mj is (λ, µ)-smooth when the mechanism restricted
valuations of the players come from a set (Vij )i∈[n] . If the valuation vi : Xi → R≥0 of each player across
mechanisms is fractionally subadditive, and can be expressed as an XOS valuation by component valuations
`
vij
∈ Vij then the global mechanism is also (λ, µ)-smooth.
Proof. See [ST13, Theorem 5.1]
This above theorem also holds for submodular valuations as submodular valuations are a strict subclass
of XOS valuations.
Imposing the condition that a mechanism is smooth allows us to put concrete bounds on the price of
anarchy.
Theorem 2.3 ([ST13]). If a mechanism is M is (λ, µ)-smooth and players have the possibility to withdraw,
then for any set of independent distributions {Fi }ni=1 over the valuations sets {Vi }ni=1 , the price of anarchy
over Bayes-Nash equilibria is at most max(µ, 1)/λ.
Proof [ST13]. Note that the deviating strategy a∗i (v, ai ) of player i required by the smoothness property
depends on the whole valuation profile v and not only on the valuation of player i. As a result a∗i (v, ai )
cannot be directly used as deviation for the player since the valuations of the other players are not known
beforehand.
Consider the following randomized deviation for each player i that depends only on the information
that he has which is own valuation vi and the equilibrium strategy s: he random samples a valuation
profile w ∼ F = ×i Fi (he can do this as the distributions are common knowledge). Then he plays
a∗i ((vi , w−i ), si (wi )), i.e., the player considers the equilibrium actions s(w), and deviates from this action
profile using the action given by the smoothness property for his true type vi , the random sample of
the types of the others w−i , and the equilibrium action si (wi ) of his randomly sampled type wi . By
assumption, this is not a profitable deviation and so
Ev [uvi i (s(v))] ≥ Ev,w [uvi i (a∗i ((vi , w−i ), si (wi )), s−i (v−i ))]
∗
i
= Ev,w [uw
i (ai ((wi , w−i ), si (vi )), s−i (v−i ))]
∗
i
= Ev,w [uw
i (ai (w, si (vi )), s−i (v−i ))]

where the first equality is an exchange of variable names, using independence. Summing over players and
using smoothness then gives

Thus PoA ≤ max(µ, 1)/λ.

2.2

Upper bounds

If we can show that first-price auctions are smooth mechanisms then Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3
immediately gives us upper bound on simultaneous first-price auctions.
Proposition 2.4. A first-price auction is a (1 − 1/e, 1)-smooth mechanism.
Proof. We follow the argumentation in Section 6 of [ST13]. Note that we can prove smoothness both for
full information setting and Bayesian setting simultaneously as the definition of a smooth mechanism
gives us a specific valuation profile. To prove smoothness we must find a randomized bidding profile
b∗ = (b∗1 , . . . , b∗n ) such that for any valuation profile v ∈ ×i Vi and for any bidding profile b ∈ ×i Bi we

and wins is uvhh (bk ) = vh − bk (assuming no overbidding). Thus
uvhh (b∗h , b−h ) =

as desired.
Corollary 2.5. The price of anarchy for simultaneous first-price auctions with submodular valuations
over mixed Nash and Bayesian-Nash equilibria is at most e/(e − 1).
5

Proof. This immediately follows by applying the previous theorem in combination with Theorem 2.2 and
Theorem 2.3 while noting that the class of mixed Nash equilibria is a subclass of Bayesian-Nash equilibria
so that an upper bound for Bayesian-Nash equilibria is an upper bound for mixed Nash equilibria. Hence
e
P oA ≤ e−1
.
To get an upper bound in the case of subadditive valuations we give an overview of the approach taken
in [FFGL13]. First some notation. Consider a bidding profile b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) where the bid ofP
Player i on
item j is given by bi (j) (for a subset S ⊂ [m] we shall also use the notation bi (S) instead of j∈S bi (j)).
We then let the price vector perceived by Player i be defined as the additive function pi : 2[m] → R≥0
whose value on j is maxk6=i bk (j), i.e., the highest bid placed by the other bidders on each item. We use
the notation vi (bi , pi ) to denote the valuation of Player i on the allocation which results from bid bi by
Player i and prices pi . Note that if the bids are randomized, then the price vector perceived by Player i,
pi , follows some distribution, call it Di .
Lemma 2.6 ([FFGL13]). For any distribution of prices D and any subadditive valuation v : X → R≥0
there exists a bid b0 such that
Ep∼D [v(b0 , p)] −

m

bj (m) ≥

j=1

1
v([m]) − Ep∼D [p([m])]
2

(2.9)

Proof due to [FFGL13]. Let b ∼ D be a bidding profile drawn from the same distribution as the prices.
We then have that
Eb∼D [Ep∼D [v(p, b)]] = Ep∼D [Eb∼D [v(p, b)]]

= Ep∼D [Eb∼D [v(p, b) + v(p, b)]]
2
1
≥ Ep∼D [Eb∼D [v([m])]]
2
1

2
where the inequality follows from the subadditivity of v. It thus follows that
1
v([m]) − Eb∼D [b([m])]
2
1
= v([m]) − Ep∼D [p([m])].
2
A mean value argument then implies that there must exist a bid b0 such that Equation 2.9 is satisfied.
Eb∼D [Ep∼D [v(p, b)] − b([m])] ≥

Theorem 2.7. The price of anarchy for simultaneous first-price auctions over Bayes-Nash equilibria
where bidders have subadditive valuations is at most 2.
Proof due to [FFGL13]. The plan is to consider a fixed Bayes-Nash equilibrium and create a deviating
strategy which we can use to get an upper bound as the deviating strategy must necessarily be worse.
To this end we first fix some notation. Let F = ×i Fi be the distribution over valuations and let s
be a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Fix a Player i and an arbitrary valuation vi drawn from Fi . Let v−i be
∗
a valuation drawn from F−i and set v = (vi , v−i ). Then, draw another valuation profile v−i
from F−i
∗
∗
∗
∗
and set v = (vi , v−i ). Let x be the corresponding optimal allocation for v which maximizes the social
welfare. Consider the price vector perceived by Player i, given by p̃i and define a new price vector pi
which is equal to p̃i on the elements in x∗i but zero elsewhere, i.e., pi is the price vector only on those
items which Player i should have in an optimal allocation. Let Di be the corresponding distribution on
prices pi = pi (b−i ), where b ∼ s(v), meaning that Di is precisely the distribution over maximum bids on
the elements in x∗i .
Using the previous lemma we have that there exists a bid vector b0i over the items in x∗i such that
1
vi (x∗i ) − Epi ∼Di [p(x∗i )].
2
Then, as s is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we must have that
Epi ∼Di [vi (b0i , pi )] − b0i (x∗i ) ≥

Ev−i ,b∼s(v) [uvi i (b)] ≥ Ev−i ,b∼s(v) [uvi i (b0i , b−i )]
= Ev−i ,b∼s(v) [vi (b0i , p̃i )] − Ev−i ,b∼s(v) [b0i (Xi (b0i , b−i ))]
≥ Epi ∼Di [vi (b0i , pi )] − b0i (x∗i ),
6

(2.10)

where the last inequality follows from the definition of Di and the fact that Xi (b0i , b−i ) ⊂ x∗i for all b−i .
Using Equation 2.10 and the definition of pi ∼ D we then have that

Lower bounds

The lower bound on the price of anarchy for simultaneous first-price auctions with OXS valuation (hence
submodular) is the same as the upper bound.
Theorem 2.8 ([CKST16]). The price of anarchy of simultaneous first-price auctions over mixed Nash
equilibria and OXS valuation is at least e/(e − 1).
Proof. We follow the approach taken in [CKST16, Theorem 3.4].
As we are interested in a lower bound it suffices to construct a simultaneous first-price auction instance
where the PoA is arbitrarily close to e/(e − 1). Let M be a simultaneous first-price auction with n + 1
players and nn items, and let I = [n]n denote the set of items.
Player 0 is a dummy player and has valuation v0 (S) = 0 for all S ⊂ I. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n we associate
Player i with one of the dimensions in the cube as follows: given S ⊂ I the valuation vi (S) is the
cardinality of S projected along dimension i which more formally can be written as
vi (S) = |{w−i | there exists wi such that (wi , w−i ) ∈ S}|.

(2.16)

It is straightforward to check that these valuations are submodular. To give a lower bound on the price of
anarchy we need to find a mixed Nash equilibrium b∗ = (b∗0 , b∗1 , . . . , b∗n ) such that the PoA is arbitrarily
close to e/(e − 1). We let the strategy of Player 0 be to always bid 0. On the other hand, we let Player i
pick a number ` ∈ [n] uniformly at random and an x according to the CDF provided by

and then bids x for every item w = (`, w−i ), with wi = ` and 0 for the rest. Tie-breaking is resolved by
giving it to Player 0—which can only happen in case of 0 bids for an item. Fix a player i and an item j,
we then let Fij (x) denote the probability that player i gets j given that he bids bi (j) = x and the rest of
the bids b−i are drawn from b∗−i . For all other players k 6= i the probability that Player k bids 0 for item
7

j is (n − 1)/n, and the probability that j is in the slice Player k bids on, but for which his bid is lower
than x, is 1/n · G(x) = G(x)/n. From this it follows that

Since Fij is invariant of i and j we can denote it with a common distribution F . Notice that vi restricted
to the slice {(`, w−i ) | w ∈ I, ` ∈ [n]} is additive. Hence, the utility for Player i of getting item j is
F (x)(1 − x) and so the utility of getting all the items in the slice he bids on is ui (b∗i ) = nn−1 · F (x)(1 − x) =
n−1
nn−1 n−1
.
n
We now show that b∗ indeed is a mixed Nash equilibrium. To do this we first fix an arbitrary w ∈ I
from which we define the column C = {(`, w−i ) | ` ∈ [n]} for Player i. Now, Player i has only bid on one
item in this column, while his valuation is additive over items from different columns (follows from being
additive over slices). In addition, in a fixed bidding profile b−i , every other player k bids the same on each
item in the column as either the column is in the slice of that player or it is not (follows from how the
slice and column is constructed). Consider therefore a deviating bid for player i in which i bids a positive
value for more than one item in C, i.e., at least x ≥ x0 > 0 where x is the highest bid for items in C. The
expected utility for this column is then strictly less than F (x)(1 − x) as the value of the two items is only
1 while he might have to pay at least x + x0 . It is therefore more optimal to bid x for only one item in C
and 0 for the rest.

is a worse deviation compared to just bidding on
one item according to G(x) and hence b∗ is a mixed Nash equilibrium.
To compute the social welfare of b∗ we first introduce random variables Zj where Zj = 1 if one of the
players 1 ≤ i ≤ n gets the item j and Zj = 0 P
otherwise (Player 0 gets the item). By additivity along the
slices we then have that the social welfare is j∈I Zj and hence the expected social welfare is

The maximum possible social welfare is nn where all items are distributed among the real players in such
a way that no two items allocated

which converges to e/(e − 1) for large n.
Theorem 2.9 ([CKST16]). The price of anarchy over mixed Nash equilibria for simultaneous first-price
with subadditive valuations is at least 2.
Proof. We follow the approach taken in [CKST16, Theorem 4.1], but relabel players to be consistent with
the AND-OR game in [HKMN11] and because not doing this leads to minor errors.
Our goal is to create scenario with a price of anarchy that is arbitrarily close to 2. To this end, consider
a scenario with n = 2 players and m items, and the following valuations:


1, if 1 ≤ |S| < m
v1 (S) = 2, if |S| = m


0, else,
(
v, if 1 ≤ |S|
v2 (S) =
0, else
where v < 1 is to be determined later. That v1 and v2 are subadditive is straightforward to check. We use
the following cumulative distribution for the bids of Player 1 and Player 2 respectively
F (y) =

v − 1/m
,
v−y

y ∈ [0, 1/m];

G(x) =

(m − 1)x
,
1−x

x ∈ [0, 1/m].

(2.20)

The bidding strategy of Player 1 is to bid y for each of the items. On the other hand the bidding strategy
of Player 2 is to pick one of the m items uniformly at random, and bid x for this item and 0 for all other.
8

In case of a tie, the item is allocated to Player 1. Let b∗ = (b∗1 , b∗2 ) denote this randomized bidding profile.
Our aim is to show that b∗ is a mixed Nash equilibrium for all v > 1/m.
If Player 1 bids a common bid y ∈ [0, 1/m] for all items then he gets m with probability G(y) and m − 1
items with probability 1 − G(y). His expected utility is thus G(y)(2 − my) + (1 − G(y))(1 − (m − 1)y) =
G(y)(1 − y) + 1 − (m − 1)y = 1. We must then show that Player 1 cannot get a higher utility by using a
deviating strategy. Let yi be the bid for item i that Player 2 makes for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Player 2 bids on item
i with probability 1/m according to G(x). Now, as G is a CDF it follows that G(x) = 1 < (m−1)x
for
1−x
x > 1/m. With y ∗ = (y1 , . . . , yn ), the expected utility of Player 1 is therefore

Similarly, if Player 2 bids any x ∈ (0, 1/m] for the one item, he gets the item with probability F (x).
His expected utility is thus F (x)(v − x) = v − 1/m. Bidding something greater than 1/m results in a
utility less than v − 1/m. What remains to show for Player 2 is that his utility while bidding for one item
is at least his utility while bidding for more items. Suppose therefore that Player 2 bids xi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
We can without loss of generality assume that xi ≥ xi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 (just reorder the items). It
then follows that Player 2 gets no item if and only if y ≥ x1 . So with probability F (x1 ), he gets at least
one item and pays at least x1 . Consequently, his expected utility is at most F (x1 )(v − x1 ) = v − 1/m.
We thus see that b∗ is a mixed Nash equilibrium.
The optimal allocation is to give all of the items to Player 1—this follows since v < 1. This allocation
has social welfare 2. Now in the mixed Nash equilibrium b∗ , Player 1 bids 0 with probability 1 − 1/mv,
and Player 2 thus gets at least one item with at least this probability. We thus have

Setting v = 1/ m we have SW (v1 ,v2 ) (b∗ ) ≤ 1 + 2/ m − 1/m and hence P oA ≥ 1+ √22 − 1 which converges

Overview of PoA for Second-Price Auctions

We will now turn our attention to second-price auctions and give a short overview of the current known
upper and lower bounds for second-price auctions. An overview of all the bounds (both first-price and
second-price) can be found in Table 1. Before giving the bounds for simultaneous second-price auctions
we formalize the notion of no-overbidding.
Definition 3.1 (Strongly no-overbidding, [FFGL13]). Given a bidding profile b = (b1 , . . . , bn ), we say
that it is strongly no-overbidding if for all i ∈ [n] and any S ⊂ [m] we have bi (S) ≤ vi (S).
Definition 3.2 (Weakly no-overbidding, [FFGL13]). Given a price distribution Di , a bidder is said to be
weakly no-overbidding if his bid vector bi satisfies Epi ∼Di [vi (X(bi , pi ))] ≥ Epi ∼Di [bi (Xi (bi , pi ))] where
Xi (bi , pi ) denotes the allocation of Player i given that he bids bi against a perceived price profile pi .

Table 1: A summary of the PoA for first-price and second-price simultaneous auctions over different
valuation classes and equilibrium types.

3.1

Upper and lower bounds

The current best known upper bound for subadditive valuations is given in [FFGL13].
Theorem 3.3 ([FFGL13]). In simultaneous second-price auctions where bidders have subadditive valuations, and every bidder is either strongly or weakly no-overbidding, the price of anarchy over Bayesian-Nash
equilibria is at most 4.
They also show the following best known lower bound:
Theorem 3.4 ([FFGL13]). In simultaneous second-price auctions where bidders have subadditive valuations, and every bidder is weakly no-overbidding, the price of anarchy over Bayesian-Nash equilibria is at
least 4/1.94 > 2.061.
For submodular valuations we have the following upper bound given in [CKS16]:
Theorem 3.5 ([CKS16]). In simultaneous second-price auctions where bidders have submodular valuations,
and every bidder is strongly no-overbidding, the price of anarchy over Bayesian-Nash equilibria is at most
2.
They do not provide results for the case of the weakly no-overbidding condition. As mentioned by
Feldman et al. in [FFGL13] the results for the strongly no-overbidding situation do not directly carry
over to the weakly no-overbidding situation. A potential area of investigation could therefore be to study
upper bounds for the PoA with submodular valuations under the weakly no-overbidding assumption.
For pure Nash equilibria, Christodoulou et al. [CKS16] showed the following related result.
Theorem 3.6 ([CKS16]). If the valuation functions are submodular, then a pure Nash equilibrium that
has PoA equal to 2 can be computed in polynomial time.
It is currently not known if such an algorithm exists for Bayesian-Nash equilibria.
