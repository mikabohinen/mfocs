In this mini project we study reflective subcategories and their properties. To motivate this a little bit, consider the category of abelian groups which are contained in the category of groups. The abelianization functor then serves as a left adjoint to this inclusion. We can then consider the monad induced by this adjunction and ask ourselves if the category of $ T $-algebras on groups ($ T $ being the monad) is equivalent to the category of abelian groups. As we shall see, this is indeed the case, and it follows from the result that the inclusion of a reflective subcategory is monadic.

We\footnote{``We'' is used only as a literary device, as this is solely my own work.} have chosen to answer the questions that accompany this mini project as an extended text which we have tried to fit together in a logical manner. Section~\ref{sec:Preliminaries} answers questions 1--4 while section~\ref{sec:Monadic Structure of Reflective Subcategories} answers question 5. More specifically, we have the map between questions and theorems/propositions/lemmas as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:map}.
