The steps of ( each ) mini project are for your guidance; if you wish to take an
alternative route to the desired goal, you are free to do so. But, if you follow
the suggested route and ﬁnd yourself unable to carry out any particular step,
you may simply assume it so that you can continue with the mini project, but
should make this assumption clear in your presentation.

The purpose of this mini-project is to deﬁne and study Lie algebra coho-
mology and homology. Let h be a ﬁeld. A k-Lie algebra is a h-Vector space
9 with a bilinear map H : g X g —> g satisfying
[337 93] = 0 (1)
[33, [31,21]] + [31, [zaxll + [Z7 [ﬁayll = 0. (2)
Morphisms of Lie algebras are linear maps compatible with the bracket. A
Lie algebra is called abelian if [90, y] = 0 for all at, y. A left g-module M is a
k—module equipped with a bilinear action map g ®k M —> M (where a (X) m
goes to 33m) such that
[90, ylm = Mum) — MW) (3)
for all x,y E g and all m E M. Morphisms of g—modules are linear maps
which commute with the actions.

1. Show that the category of g—modules is abelian.

2. Show that the category of g-modules is closed symmetric monoidal
where the action map on M ®kN is given by $(m®n) = $m®n+m®xn
3. For any associative h-algebra A let Lie(A) be the Lie algebra with
underlying k-module A and bracket given by [a, b] = ab — ba. Show
that this deﬁnes a functor from the category of associative h—algebras
to the category of Lie algebras. Show that this functor has a left adjoint
(the universal enveloping algebra denoted by U)
110.

Show that the category of g-modules is naturally isomorphic to the
category of U (g)—m0dules.

Show that the category of g—modules has enough pro jectives and enough
injectives.

. Show that the functor from k-modules to g-modules sending V to the
trivial g-module with underlying k-module V ($12 = 0 for all x E g
and all 1) E V) has a left adjoint (coinvariants denoted by Mg) and
a right adjoint (invariants denoted by M g). Denote by H*(g, M) the
left derived functor of coinvariants, and by H* (g, M) the right derived
functor of invariants.

Show that if M is a trivial g—module then H1(g, M) 2’ (g/[g,g]) 6% M.

Deﬁne the Chevalley-Ez'lenberg complex. Show that it gives a projective
resolution of the trivial g-module k. You are allowed to use the PBW
theorem as long as you state it precisely.

Let M be a g—module. Deﬁne what is a Lie algebra extension of g by
M (viewed as an abelian Lie algebra). Deﬁne when two extensions are
equivalent. Show that H2(g, M) is in a natural one to one correspon—
dence with the set of equivalence classes of Lie algebra extensions of g
byM.

Discuss more examples of Lie algebra cohomology computations. One
possibility is the BGG resolution and how it can be used to compute
Lie algebra cohomology of Borel subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras
(Bott’s theorem).
